# Straight 5

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a repo dedicated to the SPA that hosts Straight 5, a game designed, created and coded by me.

## Running it yourself

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

First you must install all the necessary dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

This app uses react and gh-pages to deploy it using `npm run deploy` which will run tests, prepare the build and then deploy the github pages. The live app can be found at [https://andyrewwer.github.io/straight5](https://andyrewwer.github.io/straight5)
